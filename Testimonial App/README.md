The Testimonial Card App is a React-based project designed to display a series of testimonials or reviews, one card at a time. Each card contains a person's information, such as their name, photo, job title and desctiption. Users can navigate through the testimonials using intuitive controls provided by three buttons:

1. Next Button: Moves to the next testimonial card.
2. Previous Button: Goes back to the previous testimonial card.
3. Surprise Me Button: Randomly shuffles and displays a different testimonial, ensuring that the app loops through the cards continuously.
