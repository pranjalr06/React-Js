The Tour Card App is an interactive web application designed to showcase multiple tour cards to users. Users can browse through the cards, and if they are not interested in a particular tour, they can click a "Not Interested" button. This temporarily removes the card from view. Once all tour cards have been removed, a "Refresh" button appears, allowing the user to reload and view all the tour cards again.
